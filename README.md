# simpleCalculator
Simple Calculator GUI as a first interaction with Python and Tkinter! Excited to use this new skill in implementing some of my bigger projects with an interface.

Previously I had really only worked heavily in Java, but I want to expand my skill set so I started learning Python over break.
I am also intersted in visualizing some of my projects, using a GUI would do that! Here I built a very simple calculator that does basic arithmetic. This project helped me develop a great base knowledge, I am excited to do more with this skill!
